# Character-recognition
Added code for hand written Character recognition using tensorflow and pytorch.

The team has come together to address a more challenging character recognition problem. In this case, they are working with higher-resolution grayscale images of hand-written letters. The objective is to develop a system or model that can accurately identify and classify these characters. The use of higher-resolution images allows for more detailed and nuanced information to be captured, making the recognition task more complex. The team will need to explore advanced techniques and algorithms to effectively extract relevant features from the images and train a model that can accurately recognize and classify the hand-written letters. This endeavor requires a deeper understanding of character recognition and the ability to work with more intricate and detailed data.


Input: This represents the initial input data for the model.

Conv2D layer: This is a convolutional layer with 32 filters, a kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation, and BatchNormalization. It performs convolutional operations on the input data to extract relevant features.

MaxPooling2D layer: This layer performs max pooling with a pool size of (2,2), reducing the spatial dimensions of the data while preserving important features.

Conv2D layer: Another convolutional layer with 64 filters, a kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation, and BatchNormalization. It further extracts features from the data.

MaxPooling2D layer: Another max pooling layer with a pool size of (2,2) to reduce the spatial dimensions.

Conv2D layer: A third convolutional layer with 128 filters, a kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation, and BatchNormalization, extracting more complex features.

MaxPooling2D layer: Another max pooling layer with a pool size of (2,2).

Flatten layer: This layer converts the multidimensional data into a one-dimensional vector, preparing it for the fully connected layers.

Dense layer: A fully connected layer with 256 units and ReLU activation. It performs computations on the flattened data.

BatchNormalization layer: This layer normalizes the outputs of the previous layer, helping to stabilize and speed up the training process.

Dropout layer: A regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, in this case with a dropout rate of 0.5. It helps prevent overfitting.

Dense layer: The final fully connected layer with 27 units and softmax activation. It produces the output probabilities for the 27 classes (or labels) of the problem being solved.

Overall, this sequence of layers represents a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture commonly used for image classification tasks. The model takes input data, applies a series of convolutional and pooling operations to extract features, flattens the data, passes it through fully connected layers, and finally produces a probability distribution over the 27 classes. The BatchNormalization and Dropout layers help improve the model's generalization and performance.
